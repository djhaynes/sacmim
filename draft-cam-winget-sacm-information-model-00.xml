<t>This document defines the data types and data relations and operations that comprise the information model for Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring (SACM) of posture information. This information model is maintained as the IANA &ldquo;SACM Information Elements&rdquo; registry.  This document defines the initial set and contents to address SACM&rsquo;s use cases (RFC7632).</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>The purpose of the SACM Information Model (IM) is to ensure
interoperability between SACM data models that are used as transport
encoding and to provide a base set of information elements and
operations that may be exposed or shared between SACM components.  A
complete set of requirements imposed on the IM can be found in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-sacm-requirements"/>. The SACM IM leverages existing definitions of
information elements and references the sources in the corresponding
descriptions so as to minimize re-invention and duplication.  The
SACM IM itself is intended to be used for data exchange between SACM
components (data in motion). Nevertheless, the Information Elements (IEs) defined in
this document can be leveraged to create and align corresponding data
models for data at rest.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="information-elements-ie" title="Information Elements (IE)">

<t>Every type or group of information, e.g. the information elements,
defined in this document represent content transported by a
SACM component and are associated with a unique label: their name.
This document defines that set of IEs standardized by SACM.  A SACM
data model MAY include additional IEs that are not defined in this
document.  The labels of additional IEs included in different SACM
data models MUST NOT conflict with the labels of the IEs defined by
this information model, and the names of additional IEs MUST NOT
conflict with each other or across multiple data models.  In order to
avoid naming conflicts, the labels of additional IEs SHOULD be
prefixed to avoid collision across extensions.  The prefix MUST
include an organizational identifier and therefore, for example, MAY
be an IANA enterprise number, a (partial) name space URI or an
organization name abbreviation.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="structure-of-information-elements" title="Structure of Information Elements">

<t>The IEs defined in this document are differentiated into two basic types of Information Elements:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Atomic Information Elements: an atomic IE is the simplest IE structure comprised of a single attribute value pairing (atomic IEs are listed in <xref target="AIE"/>).</t>
  
  <t>Composite Information Elements: a composite IE is a richer structure that can be comprised of one or more attribute value pairings (composite IE are listed in <xref target="CIE"/>).</t>
</list></t>

<t>To associate metadata (e.g. an observation time stamp) with an atomic information element is the equivalent of creating a composite information element that includes the initial atomic information element and an additional information element that represents the time stamp. The resulting composite information element is associated with its own unique name.</t>

<t>Four general structures are expressed via the the two basic types of IE and are used throughout the information model:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>SACM statements</t>
  <t>SACM content elements</t>
  <t>Relationship Types</t>
  <t>Events</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="atomic-information-elements-aie" title="Atomic Information Elements (AIE)">

<t>Atomic IEs represent the smallest building blocks for SACM content,
including, for example, a SACM endpoint attribute, a policy entry, a
configuration item, an expected states, or a threshold value.  AIE
can be bundled into composite IE.  The set of AIEs defined by the
SACM IM is described in section <xref target="AIE"/>.</t>

<t>In essence, AIEs are attribute value pairs that constitute the
&ldquo;leaves&rdquo; in a SACM semantic structure.  While the SACM IM sometimes
does elaborate on the structure of values (e.g. an IPv6 address is an
octet string with a maximum length of 16 that my be collapsed in
certain conditions), it does not prescribe specific types used in the
data model representation (e.g. an unbounded character string).</t>

<t>Every AIE is registered as an corresponding entry at the IANA registry.
The Integer Index of the IANA SMI number tables can be used by SACM data models.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="composite-information-elements-cie" title="Composite Information Elements (CIE)">

<t>Composite IEs constitute bundles of atomic AIEs and/or composite IEs.
A CIE represents a specific set of related information that share a
semantic relationship, e.g. a SACM statement metadata or state
information about a network interface. The set of CIEs defined by the
SACM IM is described in section <xref target="CIE"/>. In essence, CIEs are a &ldquo;named
container&rdquo; construct that can be used to compose additional CIEs that
go beyond the ones standardized by the SACM information model.</t>

<t>The SACM IM allows for recursive or circular nesting of composite
IEs.  A SACM data Model (DM) MUST include the &ldquo;default-depth&rdquo; base
AIE that is part of the SACM content metadata.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sacm-statements" title="SACM Statements">

<t>The data exchanged between SACM components is always embedded in a
SACM statement.  SACM Statements contain one or more CIEs and/or
AIEs.  A SACM statement functions as an &ldquo;envelope&rdquo; type that is
associated with metadata about the providing SACM component.  The
SACM statement metadata can be used to resolve conflicting
information, retrace the provenance of information or to locate
archived information in data repositories.</t>

<t>Examples of SACM statement metadata information elements:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>SACM Domain Identifier: a globally unique identifier that enables
the differentiation of SACM statements across SACM domains.</t>
  <t>Data Origin: the SACM domain unique identifier associated with a SACM component.</t>
  <t>Statement Identifier: an identifier that enables to uniquely reference this specific statement.</t>
</list></t>

<t>SACM statements are comprised of one or more CIEs; <xref target="example-composition-of-sacm-statements"/> provides examples for constructing SACM statements.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sacm-content-elements" title="SACM Content Elements">

<t>SACM Content Elements are categorized CIEs.  The content elements can
be composed of one or mnore AIEs and/or CIEs or it can be another
representation that is embedded in the statement, for example, an
IPFIX Template Record.  Each SACM content element has its own Content
Metadata associated with it (analogously to the way that each SACM
statement has metadata associated to it).  Content element metadata
include information about its type, data source (the result produced
by a collector) or data origin (the result produced by most other
SACM components).</t>

<t>Examples of SACM content element metadata information elements:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Target Endpoint Label: an identifier that enables to distinctly
identify a target endpoint as a SACM content element.</t>
  <t>Relationship Identifier(s): a set of semantic relationships that
associate this SACM content element with other SACM content
elements via their content element identifier.</t>
  <t>Content Element Identifier: an identifier that enables to uniquely
reference this specific content element.</t>
</list></t>

<t>SACM content elements are described in section FIXME.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="relationship-types" title="Relationship Types">

<t>Relationships are expressed via AIE contained within a CIE. There are two ways SACM content elements are associated with each other. &ldquo;A Flow&rdquo; associated with &ldquo;A User&rdquo;, for example, would be a typical case, in which two separate SACM content elements could be associated with each other.</t>

<t>One way is to include the Relationships AIE in the content element metadata that preludes the actual content (in this example, the content element metadata of the flow record). Relationship Types are uni-directional. For example, the &ldquo;is-associated-with-user&rdquo; Relationship AIE included in the content element metadata points to a specific user via a corresponding content element identifier.</t>

<t>The alternative way is to include the reference of associated information directly into the content of the content element. A session CIE, for instance, could refer to a specific user by including identifying attributes about that user. While this is a valid way of creating a relationship between different kinds of content, it requires careful matching or the introduction of another appropriate identifier mechanism (that does not conflict with other SACM statements and SACM content element identifiers).
If a SACM data model allows for transport of other representations as payload of a content element (e.g. a pcap fragment containing suspicious packets, for example), there might be no alternative as to use the content element metadata to include relationships to other content elements.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="events" title="Events">

<t>Events are a specific type of CIE that are always associated with a
time stamp and represent a change of state or configuration that can
be expressed as a SACM content.  The time an event was published by a
SACM component is recorded in its corresponding SACM statement
metadata, the time it was created (or initially observed) is recorded
in its content element metadata.  It is also recorded in the CIE
itself, which is somewhat redundant but can improve performance in
some scenarios.  Event CIE can also include the past state or
configuration before the change occurred, or &ndash; if applicable &ndash; a
threshold or trigger condition that lead to the creation of the
event.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="information-element-vocabulary" title="Information Element Vocabulary">

<t>The vocabulary of Information Element names standardized by the SACM IM does not prescribe the use of these exact same names in every SACM data model. If terms diverge, a mapping has to be provided in the corresponding SACM data model document.</t>

<t>A subset of the names of the information elements defined in this document are appended with &ldquo;-type&rdquo;. This indicates that the IM defines a set of values for these information elements (e.g. the interface types defined by the IANA registry or the relationship types).</t>

<section anchor="vocabulary-of-categories" title="Vocabulary of Categories">

<t>Categories are special Information Elements that enable to refer to multiple types of IEs via just one name. Therefore, they are similar to a type-choice. A prominent example of a category is network-address. Network-address is a category that every kind of network address is associated with, e.g. mac-address, ipv4-address, ipv6-address, or typed-network-address. If a CIE includes network-address as one of its components, any of that categories members is valid to be used in its stead.</t>

<t>Another prominent example is EndpointIdentifier. Some IEs can be used to identify (and over time re-recognize) target endpoints - those are associated with the category endpoint-identifier.</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='content:'>
  this is a very broad category. Content is the payload of a content element in a SACM statement. Formally, metadata is the complement to content and everything that is not part of SACM statement metadata or content element metadata is therefore considered to be content. Every IE can be content (although the same type of IE can be used in the metadata at the same time - and those would not be content as described before). Annotating every IE with this category would be highly redundant and is therefore omitted for brevity.</t>

<section anchor="AIE" title="Vocabulary of Atomic Information Elements">

<t>The content of every Atomic Information Element is expressed in a single value. Note that while this section lists AIEs, some of them may also be represented as a CIE (especially if metadata is used).</t>

Theoretically every kind of information can be associated with a target endpoint CIE via its corresponding content element. A few select IE can be stored in the CIE itself to reduce the overhead of following references that would occur in most scenarios. If the hostname is unknown the value has to be set as an equivalent to &ldquo;not available&rdquo; (e.g. NULL).

<section anchor="example-composition-of-sacm-statements" title="Example composition of SACM statements">

<t>This section illustrates how SACM statements can be composed of content information elements, how relationship CIEs can be used in content metadata, and how the categories statement-type, content-topic and content-type are intended to be used.</t>

<t>The SACM statements instances are written in pseudo code. AIE end with a colon. Some AIE include exemplary values to, for example, present how references to guid and labels can be used. For the sake of brevity, not all mandatory IE that are part of a CIE are always included (e.g. as it is the case with target-endpoint).</t>

<t>The example shows three SACM statements that were produced by three different SACM components that overall include four related content elements.</t>
